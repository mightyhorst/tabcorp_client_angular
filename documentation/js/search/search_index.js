repo \n\n\n\nApplication\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAngular6\nAngular6 is used as the simple SPA framework.\n\n\nExpressJs\nThe app is served by ExpressJs. We could also use this as a simple resourceful API too, however we have chosen to use microservices on Lambda\n\n\nDocker\nDocker is probably overkill here, but is used as a simple container to quickly setup the Angular/Express app on all environments (dev/test/staging)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBeanstalk\nAngular App is served using ExpressJs inside a Docker container\n\n\nAWS Gateway\nThe Angular App calls the AWS Gateway\n\n\nLambda\nA serveless microservice for handling Flickr and user management\n\n\nCognito\nnot used Used for User IAM and AAA\n\n\nDynamoDb\nUsed for saving user favourites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTravis CI\nContinuous Integration and Deployment\n\n\nDockerHub\nDocker hub is used to deploy Docker images to ElasticBeanstalk\n\n\nSwaggerHub\nSwaggerHub is used to host the API documentation here\n\n\nCompoDoc\nAngular Documentation tool\n\n\nAgile\nGithub Projects\n\n\nBackstopJS 3\nVisual regression testing for responsive CSS\n\n\nMocha\nIntegration and API Testing (used for backend repo.

If these pass then the master branch will be deployed to the staging environment.\n\n\nStaging\nThe master branch will be deployed to the staging environment after all tests pass on the test environment.\n\n\nProduction\nThe production branch will be deployed to the production environment after all tests pass on the test environment. This is not setup for our simple example\n\n\n\nPipeline\nTravisCi is used as our Continuous Integration service. \nTests - Backend\nThe api documentation is available on SwaggerHub here\n\navailable here: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/kitset-io/tabcorp-microservice-book-api/1.0.0\nBDD - Backend\nThe integration tests are written in mocha available from the backend repo. \n\nTests - Frontend\nThe front end tests are split into e2e tests, unit tests and integration tests using angular cli tool, jasmine and karma. \n \nDevelopment Lifecycle\nDepending on the client tradeoffs between time, cost and quality I would follow the following development lifecycle including agile approach, extreme programming and BDD. \n\n\nDepending on the project, I typically have stagered design + development sprints \n\n\n\nSprint\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nPlan > UX > UI > Backlog\n\n\nDevelopment\nPlan > User Stories > Test > Code > Deploy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Story\nLifecycle\n\n\n\n\nUser Story\nCreate issue for each user story\n\n\nUX + UI\nIf no design phase, create wireframes and PSD/Sketch designs if applicable\n\n\nFailing Test\nDesign e2e test and unit test that fail\n\n\nCode\nCreate new branch for each user story.\n\n\nPassing Test\nWrite code to pass tests\n\n\nCommit\nRefactor to pass all tests and pull request for merge to master branch\n\n\nTest Env\nPush to test environment\n\n\nStaging\nIf tests pass, push to staging\n\n\nReview\nBusiness owner to review then push to production branch\n\n\nProduction\nIf passes tests, push to production\n\n\nRetrospective\nCollect feedback for sprint retrospective or add to product backlog\n\n\n\nPlan\nWe will use SCRUM as our agile methodology. Before the sprint starts we need to source the Product Backlog from the Business Owner and the roles we will be serving as our customer. \nWe will use Trello, Jira or Github Projects as our agile tool. \nThe roles are simple, we have one user. Optionally, it is typically helpful and improves enaggement with the client or business owner to source a persona for our roles rather than just saying \"user\" in our stories. This helps us focus on delivering value for the customer. \ne.g. Kayla as \"User\"\n\n\nThe epics for this sprint include: \n\n\n\nID\nEpic\n\n\n\n\nEpic 1:\nAs a user, I want to view the public feed from Flickr, so that I can save my favourites\n\n\nEpic 2:\nAs a user, I want to search for topics from the flickr feed, so that I can save time looking for topics I like\n\n\nEpic 3:\nAs a user, I want to save my favourites, so that I can view them quickly when I return to the app\n\n\nEpic 4:\nAs a user, I want a simple sidebar, so that I can navigate between Flickr, searches and favourites\n\n\n\nUX and UI\nThese epics can be further broken down into the following user stories by creating wireframes for the UX (User Experience)\n\n\n\n\n\nParent ID\nUI Epic\n\n\n\n\nEpic 1:\nAs a user, I want a Flickr list page\n\n\nEpic 1:\nAs a user, I want a Flickr details page\n\n\nEpic 2:\nAs a user, I want a search page\n\n\nEpic 3:\nAs a user, I want a favourites page\n\n\n\nBDD -
